## PCB Disclaimer
We also provide STEP models of our PCBs so that other designers can make compatible products. For most of our PCBs, we also have a daughterboard based variant, which we can also share, but are not listed here.

If you're interested in sourcing PCBs for a project from us, or want the daughterboard based models, please reach out to support@cannonkeys.com! We aim to try to keep these PCBs in-stock, so that your customers and supporters can easily obtain replacement PCBs.

These models are provided under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). You are free to use them for commercial purposes, but you have to give us credit - but not in any way that suggests the we endorse you or your use. No warranties are given - these files are provided as-is, and by using them, you agree to take responsibility for their use.
