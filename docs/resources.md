## Commonly Used Parts
In many of our CannonKeys designed products, we use the same parts. This is true for a lot of burger mounted O-rings, OLEDs, encoders, etc. This chart shows what those products are and where you can buy extras, if you so desire.

In particular, these M2 screws are used for the Satisfaction75 and Brutal Series Boards (Brutal60, Savage65, Obliterated75, DevastatingTKL, and Rekt1800). 

The Chimera and Balance boards use a different set of hardware, which we will add here in the near future.

## PCB Disclaimer
We also provide STEP models of our PCBs so that other designers can make compatible products. For most of our PCBs, we also have a daughterboard based variant, which we can also share, but are not listed here.

If you're interested in sourcing PCBs for a project from us, or want the daughterboard based models, please reach out to support@cannonkeys.com! We aim to try to keep these PCBs in-stock, so that your customers and supporters can easily obtain replacement PCBs.

These models are provided under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). You are free to use them for commercial purposes, but you have to give us credit - but not in any way that suggests the we endorse you or your use.
