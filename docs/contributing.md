# Contributing to CannonKeys Documentation

Our docs site is fully open source, and created using a tool called MkDocs.
Each page you see on this site is defined by a markdown file that's uploaded into our github repository.

We welcome community contributions to our docs. If there is information that is missing that you think could be useful, feel free to contribute!

If you're not sure where to start, we put together this little guide.

## Prerequisites 

There are some prerequisites that you will need:

- A Github account
- The Github Desktop app
- Knowlege of how to write [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). If you don't know how to do this - it's pretty easy to pick up.
- Some way to edit markdown - we recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Ghostwriter](https://ghostwriter.kde.org/) as they have live preview capabilities.


## Forking the Repo

1. First, we need to make our own copy of the ck-docs repository. This will allow us to make changes to our copy without modifying the live ck-docs page.

1. Follow the prompts and finish creating your fork.

1. Before starting any new contributions, make sure you sync your fork with the upstream ck-docs repo. This will pull any changes from the main cannonkeys/ck-docs into your forked copy.

1. Next, we need to download the repo to our computer so we can make changes. Open and login to Github Desktop. You should see a screen like the one shown below. Select "Clone a repository from the internet".

## Making Local Changes

1. Now, we need to make our desired changes. Use your selected app to create or modify files as necessary to contribute to the Markdown docs.

1. As you change files, you'll see them show up in Github Desktop as changed files.
