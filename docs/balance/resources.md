# Balance Resources

## QMK

The Balance keyboard is powered by QMK - the code is open source and available [here](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/cannonkeys/balance)

To flash the keyboard, please follow our [Chimera65 flashing guide](../chimera65/flashing.md). The Balance PCB is flashed using the same method.

## VIA
The VIA JSON for using VIA with the Balance is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-via/keyboards/fb083ac5451050e41328a579c57f8b3532600c35/src/cannonkeys/balance/balance.json).

Once our pull request is accepted to the VIA keyboard repo, this JSON will no longer be necessary, but is here as a reference.

## General

The knobs used on Balance have a 19mm outer diameter.


The screws used are:

- M2 x 4 Flat Head Screws (Accent and Daughterboard Screws)

- M2.5 x 8 Socket Cap Screws (Case Screws)

Note that the M2x4 flat head screws are also used for the top accent pieces.
