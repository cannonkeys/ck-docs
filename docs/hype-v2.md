## CannonKeys Hype V2 Guide

**Link:** [https://hype.cannonkeys.com/](https://hype.cannonkeys.com/)

!!! Note Nothing is yours until checkout is complete. If an item goes out of stock between joining the queue and entering checkout it will be removed from your order. At this point, you can either continue checking out, or go back to the start and reenter.

# Quick Guide
1. Go to the website and click the shop button.
2. Create your order, then click 'Review Cart' button.
3. Review your cart, then click 'Join Sale' button whenever ready. You can do this before the sale starts.
4. Wait patiently, do not leave the page. If chosen, checkout as normal.

# Creating your order

 1. Upon loading into our Hype V2 landing page, you will see two large boxes. One for order editing, and one for order creation. In order to start the buying process, click the the **Shop** button.

 2. You are now in the order creation interface! At the bottom of the screen there will be a timer counting down the time left until the sale starts. If the Raffle has already started, then you will see "Raffling has begun - join now!" at the bottom. With this new system, we let you create your order before the raffle.

4. You are now in the Review Cart section. This is the final step before entering the raffle queue! Review your cart, and when ready click the **Join Sale** button at the bottom of the screen. You can join the process before the sale starts if you wish- no need to wait until you see the "Raffling has begun" message!
