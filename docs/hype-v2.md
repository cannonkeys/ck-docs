!!! Note Nothing is yours until checkout is complete. If an item goes out of stock between joining the queue and entering checkout it will be removed from your order. At this point, you can either continue checking out, or go back to the start and reenter.

# Creating your order

 1. Upon loading into our Hype V2 landing page, you will see two large boxes. One for order editing, and one for order creation. In order to start the buying process, click the the **Shop** button.

 2. You are now in the order creation interface! At the bottom of the screen there will be a timer counting down the time left until the sale starts. If the Raffle has already started, then you will see "Raffling has begun - join now!" at the bottom. With this new system, we let you create your order before the raffle.

3. Using the drop down menus, choose your options and add everything to the cart that you wish. Anything sold out will be clearly marked. Once you have assembled your order, click on the **Review Cart** button at the bottom of the page.

4. You are now in the Review Cart section. This is the final step before entering the raffle queue! Review your cart, and when ready click the **Join Sale** button at the bottom of the screen. You can join the process before the sale starts if you wish- no need to wait until you see the "Raffling has begun" message!
